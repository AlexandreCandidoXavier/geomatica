abstract = {In many fields using empirical areal data there arises a need for interpolating from irregularly-spaced data to produce a continuous surface. These irregularly-spaced locations, hence referred to as “data points,” may have diverse meanings: in meteorology, weather observation stations; in geography, surveyed locations; in city and regional planning, centers of data-collection zones; in biology, observation locations. It is assumed that a unique number (such as rainfall in meteorology, or altitude in geography) is associated with each data point.In order to display these data in some type of contour map or perspective view, to compare them with data for the same region based on other data points, or to analyze them for extremes, gradients, or other purposes, it is extremely useful, if not essential, to define a continuous function fitting the given values exactly. Interpolated values over a fine grid may then be evaluated. In using such a function it is assumed that the original data are without error, or that compensation for error will be made after interpolation.},

abstract = {The solar downward shortwave radiation (DSWR) is the primary source of energy to Earth and a driving forcing for sensible/latent heat and water vapor fluxes over the terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. Evaluation of the DSWR spatiotemporal patterns and trends is crucial to the understanding of weather and climate variability. In this study, DSWR is investigated over Brazil between 1980 and 2016 from contemporary state-of-the-art high-resolution gridded datasets (observations, reanalyses and merged products). The results show an increase in both annual and seasonal DSWR for all regions of Brazil, with large changes over the northern, west central, and southeastern parts of the country. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ERA5) reanalysis proves to be an excellent option for investigating DSWR across Brazil, matching the observed climatology trends well. The best results are identified for the northeastern and southeastern regions during the months of March-April-May, and the poorest results for the center-west region during September-October-November. Changes in cloud cover (CC) are linked to changes in DSWR. Decadal fluctuations in CC are highly correlated with DSWR trends, with the strongest correlation (r=−0.89) in the southeast region, and weakest correlation (r=−0.37) in the north. We conclude that CC is a primary modulating factor of brightening across Brazil between 1980 and 2016. In a global context, our results agree with observations from other regions over the globe. Our results may indicate changes in the rainy seasons across Brazil, especially in the northeast. Future studies may use these results to further understand the impacts of brightening over Brazil on solar energy production and agriculture.}

abstract={The objective of this work is to evaluate the occurrence of fire foci during the severe drought that occurred in 2005 in the State of Amazonas. The study was conducted in the State of Amazonas, which is inserted in the northern region of Brazil. The main types of vegetation are Igap{\'o} Forest, V{\'a}rzea Forest and Terra Firme Forest. Kernel density was used to spatialize fire foci to quantify them in seven classes of land use and cover (forest, pasture, exposed soil, urban area, pastoral agroforestry system, agroforestry system and agriculture). Through the regression analysis, the relation among the number of fire foci and four meteorological variables was obtained: rainfall, evapotranspiration, relative humidity and average air temperature. Forest and pasture classes were those with the highest number of fire foci corresponding, respectively, to 58 and 37{\%} of the total number of foci. This can be explained by the greater representativeness of these classes in the State and by the high degree of soil exposure in the case of pasture. The number of fire foci was higher in the dry season, covering approximately 85{\%} of the total fire foci. The variable that had the greatest influence on the occurrence of fire foci in the dry season was evapotranspiration. The study puts on alert the vulnerability of the State of Amazonas to the occurrence of fires and may also suggest actions to mitigate carbon emissions and biomass stock. Research like this one may provide subsidies to region's managers in an attempt to preserve forest areas and a greater controlling in priority areas considered very high.},

abstract = {Over the course of a few decades, soybeans in Brazil evolved from being a localized crop, with planting suitable only in regions with long photoperiods, to being the most cultivated crop countrywide. This happened thanks to the development of varieties that allowed changes in the planting calendar, permitting both cultivation in lower latitudes and the adoption of modern double-cropping systems. Here we develop a spatial dataset of Brazilian soy planting-window estimates for rainfed single and double cropping as a function of time during the period 1974–2012 by combining estimates of two important historical limitations: photoperiod and duration and timing of the rainy season. We apply the same methods to future climate estimates to investigate a possible contraction in the area of double cropping due to changes in the rainy season with global change. The resulting dataset agrees with time-invariant official agricultural zoning and optimal yield experiments and provides unprecedented spatial and temporal information on the soy growing season in Brazil. Analysis of the evolution of planting limitations shows that the relaxation of photoperiod limitations gradually made double cropping possible in central–northern Brazil in the 1980s by lengthening the planting window and allowing farmers to make use of a larger portion of the rainy season. Due to these developments, there were 20 Mha potentially suitable for double cropping in 2012, and this potential has been increasingly exploited. Under the constraints of current widely used crop varieties, we predict that climate change poses a severe threat to this potential, causing area reductions of ∼17% in central Brazil and 61% in the MATOPIBA region, known as the world’s newest agricultural frontier.}

abstract = {CONTEXT
The increasing world demand for palm oil led to the expansion of oil palm plantations, especially in the new lands in Southeast Asia, the main producing region in the world. The expansion of oil palm plantations has also occurred in Latin American countries, such as Brazil. Roughly 400 million hectares in Brazil are suitable for the planting of oil palm, but most of this area is currently covered by forest, mainly by the Amazon Rainforest. Climate change has reduced the extent of land suitable for oil palm cultivation in Brazil since under unfavorable climatic conditions, crop yields are reduced. To reconcile the increase in oil palm production in Brazil with the preservation of forests, modeling has been used as a tool to define the best suitable areas for planting expansion, as well as for the assessment of management techniques that aim to increase the yield.
OBJECTIVE
Thus, the object of this study was to implement the oil palm crop sub-model in the ECOSMOS integrated simulator and to evaluate its performance to simulate oil palm energy and carbon balance and the crop yield.
METHODS
The carbon allocation scheme for oil palm is quite different from the other crops of ECOSMOS. So, we use the sub-PFT (plant functional type) approach, where each phytomer in the plant evolves simultaneously, but individually.
RESULTS AND Conclusions
The results showed that the model was able to simulate net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) with good accuracy. In contrast, the sensible heat flux (H) was not well simulated due to the lack of information on the soil's physical-hydric properties. The model simulated accurately the annual yield for plants aged between 12 and 25 years, whereas the yield was overestimated for plants aged outside this range. Also, the model better simulated the yield of genetic varieties with seasonal yield, compared to varieties with more uniform yield over the months.
SIGNIFICANCE
The robust and consistent results presented for most of the evaluated processes, especially for energy and carbon fluxes, make the oil palm sub-model described here suitable for improve the oil palm production in Brazil. For future studies, efforts should be directed to consider key factors for oil palm, such as the ratio between male and female inflorescences and the abortion rate of inflorescences, which affect crop yield, for a better understanding of the oil palm growth and production.}

abstract = {The soybean-maize succession is an important production system used in Brazil. The greatest challenge related to this kind of system is to define the best sowing dates for the producing regions with different climatic characteristics, improving farmer´s economic profitability. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the best sowing dates for the above-mentioned crop system considering simulations with three crop simulation models (FAO-AZM, DSSAT and APSIM) in a multi-model approach, and to determine the economic profitability of this system at national scale. Previously calibrated and validated models were used to simulate soybean yields for 29 locations in 12 states, with sowing dates ranging from end of September to beginning of January for a period of 34 years (1980–2013). The maize off-season sowing was done just after the soybean harvest, ranging from end of January to beginning of May. The yield data was converted to gross revenue according to the prices commonly practiced in Brazil and then to net revenue by subtracting the production costs for each assessed region. The optimal sowing date varied according to the Brazilian region. For Central Brazil, the highest net revenue was obtained when soybean was sown between the end of September and beginning of October. This period is also recommended in Southern Brazil, because sowing delay can reduce maize yield due to risks of frosts and low solar radiation availability. In the Northern Brazil, mainly in Pará state, the soybean sowing should start in November, when net revenue is maximized.}

	abstract = {Forest cover loss in the tropics is well known to cause warming at deforested sites, with maximum temperatures being particularly sensitive. Forest loss causes warming by altering local energy balance and surface roughness, local changes that can propagate across a wide range of spatial scales. Consequently, temperature increases result from not only changes in forest cover at a site, but also by the aggregate effects of non-local forest loss. We explored such non-local warming within Brazil’s Amazon and Cerrado biomes, the region with the world’s single largest amount of forest loss since 2000. Two datasets, one consisting of in-situ air temperature observations and a second, larger dataset consisting of ATs derived from remotely-sensed observations of land surface temperature, were used to quantify changes in maximum temperature due to forest cover loss at varying length-scales. We considered undisturbed forest locations (1 km2 in extent), and forest loss trends in annuli (‘halos’), located 1–2 km, 2–4 km, 4–10 km and 10–50 km from these undisturbed sites. Our research finds significant and substantial non-local warming, suggesting that historical estimates of warming due to forest cover loss under-estimate warming or mis-attribute warming to local change, where non-local changes also influence the pattern of temperature warming.}

These datasets combine daily resolution data from retrospective analyses (the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, MERRA, and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis, CFSR) with in situ and remotely-sensed observational datasets for temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation, leading to substantial reductions in bias in comparison to a network of 2324 agricultural-region stations from the Hadley Integrated Surface Dataset (HadISD). Results compare favorably against the original reanalyses as well as the leading climate forcing datasets (Princeton, WFD, WFD-EI, and GRASP), and AgMERRA distinguishes itself with substantially improved representation of daily precipitation distributions and extreme events owing to its use of the MERRA-Land dataset. These datasets also peg relative humidity to the maximum temperature time of day, allowing for more accurate representation of the diurnal cycle of near-surface moisture in agricultural models. AgMERRA and AgCFSR enable a number of ongoing investigations in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) and related research networks, and may be used to fill gaps in historical observations as well as a basis for the generation of future climate scenarios.}

ABSTRACT = {Understanding the long-term behavior of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration (PET) over watersheds is crucial for the monitoring of hydrometeorological processes and climate change at the regional scale. The S&atilde;o Francisco watershed (SFW) in Brazil is an important hydrological system that transports water from humid regions throughout the Brazilian semiarid region. However, long-term, gapless meteorological data with good spatial coverage in the region are not available. Thus, gridded datasets, such as the Climate Research Unit TimeSeries (CRU TS), can be used as alternative sources of information, if carefully validated beforehand. The objective of this study was to assess CRU TS (v4.02) rainfall and PET data over the SFW, and to evaluate their long-term (1942&ndash;2016) climatological aspects. Point-based measurements retrieved from rain gauges and meteorological stations of national agencies were used for validation. Overall, rainfall and PET gridded data correlated well with point-based observations (r = 0.87 and r = 0.89), with a poorer performance in the lower (semiarid) portion of the SFW (r ranging from 0.50 to 0.70 in individual stations). Increasing PET trends throughout the entire SFW and decreasing rainfall trends in areas surrounding the semiarid SFW were detected in both gridded (smoother slopes) and observational (steeper slopes) datasets. This study provides users with prior information on the accuracy of long-term CRU TS rainfall and PET estimates over the SFW.},

	were compared in a mountainous region (Asturias in the North of Spain)
	derived from five geostatistical and two regression models, using
	data for January (coolest month) and August (warmest month). The
	geostatistical models include the ordinary kriging (OK), developed
	in the \{XY\} plane and in the X, Y and Z-axis (OKxyz), with zonal
	anisotropy in the Z-axis (variogram fitting procedure developed in
	this study), and three techniques that introduce elevation as an
	explanatory variable: ordinary kriging with external drift (OKED)
	and universal kriging, using the ordinary least squares (OLS) residuals
	to estimate the variogram (UK1) or the generalised least squares
	(GLS) residuals (UK2). The OKED, \{UK1\} and \{UK2\} techniques were
	more satisfactory than \{OK\} in terms of standard prediction error
	and mean absolute error, which were inferior by 1&#xa0;Â°C, but \{OKxyz\}
	improved the results obtained with those techniques. Moreover, OKxyz,
	OKED, \{UK1\} and \{UK2\} improved slightly the results of a regression
	model with \{UTM\} coordinates and elevation data as independent
	variables in terms of bias (R1); whereas a complex regression model,
	which includes altitude, latitude, distance to the sea and solar
	radiance as independent variables (R2), showed better results in
	terms of mean absolute error, under 0.16&#xa0;Â°C for both months.
	A second validation carried out with stations discarded for the interpolation
	showed a greater similarity between the efficiency of \{R2\} and
	the geostatistical techniques. },

	of Geographical Information Systems for Land Resources Assessment
	which was first published in 1986. GIS are not just used for electronic
	map-making but today are major tools for the management of our physical
	and social environment. GIS are used to assist political decisions
	and play a part in market research, in the management of utility
	services, in automated navigation systems and in many other fields.
	This book presents a strong theoretical basis for GIS, which is often
	lacking in other texts. Spatial data are usually based on two, dichotomous
	paradigms, exactly defined entities in space, such as land parcels,
	or the continuous variation of single attributes, such as temperature
	or rainfall. Methods for modelling both kinds of phenomena and storing
	them in spatial databases are described in detail, including the
	use of geostatistics for interpolating from points to continuous
	fields. Examples of how spatial data and an analysis of their spatial
	interactions are used to solve a wide range of practical problems
	ranging from site-location analysis through land degradation, the
	optimizing of timber extraction from forests and the redistribution
	of Chernobyl radioactivity by floods are explained clearly and in
	detail. Much attention is paid to the problems of data quality and
	how statistical errors in spatial data can affect the results of
	spatial modelling based on the two paradigms of space. Fuzzy logic
	and continuous classification methods are presented as methods for
	linking the two spatial paradigms. The book concludes with an investigation
	of current developments in providing spatial data for the whole world
	over the Internet. As such the new volume provides a comprehensive
	and concise introduction to the theory and practice of Geographical
	Information Systems (GIS). Targeted at undergraduates, graduates,
	and professionals in disciplines such as physical and human geography,
	hydrology, geology, environmental science, cartography, epidemiology,
	radioecology, agriculture, spatial planning, land tenure, and land
	evaluation the book explains why spatial data and the information
	systems based on them are important in the modern world.}},

	from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on
	board the Earth Observing System-Terra platform. Two \{MODIS\} vegetation
	indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
	enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions
	and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis
	of the \{MODIS\} \{NDVI\} and \{EVI\} performance from both radiometric
	and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive
	and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance
	and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence
	between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and \{VI\}
	values with those from the \{MODIS\} sensor at four intensively measured
	test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical
	forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures
	also demonstrated the scientific utility of the \{MODIS\} VI. Multitemporal
	profiles of the \{MODIS\} \{VIs\} over numerous biome types in North
	and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons
	of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles
	showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity.
	The dynamic range of the \{MODIS\} \{VIs\} are presented and their
	sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated
	in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the \{NDVI\} to asymptotically
	saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the
	\{EVI\} remained sensitive to canopy variations. },

  year = {2009},
  volume = {113},
  pages = {362-370},

  abstract = {Precipitation data with accurate, high spatial resolution are crucial
	for improving our understanding of basin scale hydrology. We explore
	the relation between precipitation estimates derived from the Tropical
	Rainfall Monitoring Mission (TRMM) and the normalized difference
	vegetation index (NDVI) for different spatial scales on the Iberian
	Peninsula in southern Europe, using time series from 2001 to 2007.
	Analysis shows that \{NDVI\} is a good proxy for precipitation. On
	an annual basis an exponential function best describes the relation
	between \{NDVI\} and precipitation. The optimum relation between
	\{NDVI\} and precipitation is found at an approximate scale of 75â€“100Â km.
	This is an intermediate scale and it is likely that at smaller scales
	\{NDVI\} is determined primarily by anthropogenic land use and at
	larger scales factors such as geology, soils, and temperature play
	an increasingly important role. The fact that both \{TRMM\} and \{NDVI\}
	are subject to bias due to orbital deviations, atmospheric conditions
	and imperfect retrieval algorithms could also influence the scale
	dependency. The derived relation between \{NDVI\} and precipitation
	is used to develop a new downscaling methodology that uses coarse
	scale \{TRMM\} precipitation estimates and fine scale \{NDVI\} patterns.
	The downscaled precipitation estimates are subsequently validated
	using an independent precipitation dataset. The downscaling procedure

	on water productivity, water consumption, water availability, and

	River Basin in Southern Africa, where the tool was used to assess
	the impact of converting land use on the water resources to prioritize
	areas for conversion and to track required changes in land use to
	comply with tripartite water allocation agreements. This contributed
	to confidence building and to strengthening the process of conscientious

  abstract = {The availability of precipitation data with high spatial resolution
	is of fundamental importance in several applications such as hydrology,
	meteorology and ecology. At present, there are mainly two sources
	of precipitation estimates: raingauge stations and remote sensing
	technology. However, a large number of studies demonstrated that
	traditional point measurements based on raingauge stations cannot
	reflect the spatial variation of precipitation effectively, especially
	in ungauged basins. The technology of remote sensing has greatly
	improved the quality of precipitation observations and produced reasonably
	high resolution gridded precipitation fields. These products, derived
	from satellites, have been widely used in various parts of the world.
	However, when applied to local basins and regions, the spatial resolution
	of these products is too coarse. In this paper, we present a statistical
	downscaling algorithm based on the relationships between precipitation
	and other environmental factors in the Qaidam Basin such as topography
	and vegetation, which was developed for downscaling the spatial precipitation
	fields of these remote sensing products. This algorithm is demonstrated
	with the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B43 dataset,
	the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from the Shuttle Radar Topography
	Mission (SRTM) and \{SPOT\} VEGETATION. The statistical relationship
	among precipitation, \{DEM\} and Normalized Difference Vegetation
	Index (NDVI), which is a proxy for vegetation, is variable at different
	scales; therefore, a multiple linear regression model was established
	under four different scales (0.25Â°, 0.50Â°, 0.75Â° and 1.00Â°, respectively).
	By applying a downscaling methodology, \{TRMM\} 3B43 0.25Â°&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;0.25Â°
	precipitation fields were downscaled to 1&#xa0;Ã—&#xa0;1&#xa0;km
	pixel precipitation for each year from 1999 to 2009. On the basis
	of three criteria, these four downscaled results were compared with
	each other and the regression model established at the resolution
	of 0.50Â° was selected as the final downscaling algorithm in this
	study. The final downscaled results were validated by applying the
	observations for a duration of 11&#xa0;years obtained from six raingauge
	stations in the Qaidam Basin. These results indicated that the downscaled
	result effectively captured the trends in inter-annual variability
	and the magnitude of annual precipitation with the coefficient of
	determination r2 ranging from 0.72 to 0.96 at six different raingauge
	stations.},

  abstract = {Summary Spatial rainfall is a key input to distributed hydrological
	models, and its precisions heavily affect the accuracy of stream
	flow predictions from a hydrological model. Traditional interpolation
	techniques which obtain the spatial rainfall distribution from rain
	gauge data have some limitations caused by data scarcity and bad
	quality, especially in developing countries or remote locations.
	Satellite-based precipitation products are expected to offer an alternative
	to ground-based rainfall estimates in the present and the foreseeable
	future. For this purpose, the quality and usefulness of satellite-based
	precipitation products need to be evaluated. The present study compares
	the difference of Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) rainfall
	with rain gauges data at different time scales and evaluates the
	usefulness of the \{TRMM\} rainfall for hydrological processes simulation
	and water balance analysis at the Xinjiang catchment, located in
	the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. The results show
	at daily time step \{TRMM\} rainfall data are better at determining
	rain occurrence and mean values than at determining the rainfall
	extremes, and larger difference exists for the maximal daily and
	maximal 5-day rainfalls. At monthly time scale, good linear relationships
	between \{TRMM\} rainfall and rain gauges rainfall data are received
	with the determination coefficients (R2) varying between 0.81 and
	0.89 for the individual stations and 0.88 for areal average rainfall
	data, respectively. But the slope of regression line ranges between
	0.74 for Yingtan and 0.94 for Yushan, indicating that the \{TRMM\}
	satellite is inclined to underestimate the monthly rainfall in this
	area. The simulation of daily hydrological processes shows that the
	Water Flow Model for Lake Catchment (WATLAC) model using conventional
	rain gauge data produces an overall good fit, but the simulation
	results using \{TRMM\} rainfall data are discontented. The evaluation
	results imply that the \{TRMM\} rainfall data are unsuited for daily
	stream flow simulation in this study area with desired precisions.
	However, good performance can be received using \{TRMM\} rainfall
	data for monthly stream flow simulations. The comparison of the simulated
	annual water balance components shows that the different rainfall
	data sources can change the volume value and proportion of water
	balance components to some extent, but it generally meets the need
	of practical use. },

	indicate that: (a) the monthly precipitation rate varied considerably
	wherein summer precipitation accounted for 65.7% of the annual total
	value; (b) a decreasing trend in precipitation was found in the data
	obtained from 77 (annual) and 80 (summer) of the 98 meteorological
	stations throughout a 48&#xa0;year period (from 1961 to 2008) while

	the mean annual and summer precipitation rates decreased in a southeastern
	to northwestern trajectory throughout the 48&#xa0;year period due
	both to the influence of the East Asian monsoon and to topography.
	All these findings can help provide rational regulatory and managerial

	first, Gd is compared against daily extraterrestrial radiation that
	is received on a horizontal surface (0.03Ã—Godâ©½Gd&lt;God); second,
	Gd should only exceed by a small amount of the daily clear sky irradiation
	that is observed under highly transparent clear skies (Gd&lt;1.1Gcd);
	and third, the method uses a series of persistence checks that utilize
	the relation between daily global solar radiation and relative sunshine
	duration hours. The method is capable of identifying systematic and
	non-systematic errors and its ability has been shown in three different
	climates including semi-arid, coastal humid and very arid climates.

  abstract = {Regional or local climate change modeling studies currently require
	starting with a global climate model, then downscaling to the region
	of interest. How should global models be chosen for such studies,
	and what effect do such choices have? This question is addressed
	in the context of a regional climate detection and attribution (D&A)
	study of January-February-March (JFM) temperature over the western
	U.S. Models are often selected for a regional D&A analysis based
	on the quality of the simulated regional climate. Accordingly, 42
	performance metrics based on seasonal temperature and precipitation,
	the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Pacific Decadal
	Oscillation are constructed and applied to 21 global models. However,
	no strong relationship is found between the score of the models on
	the metrics and results of the D&A analysis. Instead, the importance
	of having ensembles of runs with enough realizations to reduce the
	effects of natural internal climate variability is emphasized. Also,
	the superiority of the multimodel ensemble average (MM) to any 1
	individual model, already found in global studies examining the mean
	climate, is true in this regional study that includes measures of
	variability as well. Evidence is shown that this superiority is largely
	caused by the cancellation of offsetting errors in the individual
	global models. Results with both the MM and models picked randomly
	confirm the original D&A results of anthropogenically forced JFM
	temperature changes in the western U.S. Future projections of temperature
	do not depend on model performance until the 2080s, after which the
	better performing models show warmer temperatures.},

  abstract = {The measure of atmospheric model performance is highly dependent on
	the quality of the observations used in the evaluation process. In
	the particular case of operational forecast centers, large-scale
	datasets must be made available in a timely manner for continuous
	assessment of model results. Numerical models and surface observations
	usually work at distinct spatial scales (i.e., areal average in a
	regular grid versus point measurements), making direct comparison
	difficult. Alternatively, interpolation methods are employed for
	mapping observational data to regular grids and vice versa. A new
	technique (hereafter called MERGE) to combine Tropical Rainfall Measuring
	Mission (TRMM) satellite precipitation estimates with surface observations
	over the South American continent is proposed and its performance
	is evaluated for the 2007 summer and winter seasons. Two different
	approaches for the evaluation of the performance of this product
	against observations were tested: a cross-validation subsampling
	of the entire continent and another subsampling of only areas with
	sparse observations. Results show that over areas with a high density
	of observations, the MERGE technique’s performance is equivalent
	to that of simply averaging the stations within the grid boxes. However,
	over areas with sparse observations, MERGE shows superior results.},

  abstract = {Abstract Crop water requirements of crops in agro-ecological units (AEUs) of Palakkad district of humid tropical Kerala computed with \{CROPWAT\} 8.0 using the meteorological parameters.The major cultivated crops are rice, coconut, banana, arecanut, vegetables, pulses, rubber, tea, coffee, cotton etc. The total water requirement for these crops in various agro-ecological zones has been computed. Using the evapotranspiration (ET0) and effective rainfall in each agro-ecological unit (AEU), a climatic water balance has been worked out. The net irrigation demand, the gross irrigation demand and irrigation interval for the various crops grown in different \{AEUs\} have been computed. The gross irrigation demand for the district is 1146 Mm3, in which 981 Mm3 is from surface water and 165 Mm3 from groundwater sources. Water balance analysis was done for the current scenario and future demand for agriculture, domestic and industrial demand. The projected future total water demands for irrigation, drinking and industrial purpose will be 3841 Mm3. However, the secondary data showed that utilizable water resources of Palakkad district is less and will create a deficit scenario. This deficit indicates that if the total area is brought under irrigation there will be deficit years and during such periods deficit irrigation or reduction in command area may have to be adopted. A wide spectrum of scenarios has been discussed in the paper along with the guidelines for future management of water resources. },

	stations spanning from 1981 to 2009 across China were used to accelerate
	understandings of the response of wheat growth and productivity to
	climate change in different climate zones, with panel regression
	models. We found climate during wheat growth period had changed significantly
	during 1981â€“2009, and the change had caused measurable impacts
	on wheat growth and yield in most of the zones. Wheat anthesis date
	and maturity date advanced significantly, and the lengths of growth
	period before anthesis and whole growth period were significantly
	shortened, however the length of reproductive growth period was significantly
	prolonged despite of the negative impacts of temperature increase.
	The increasing adoption of cultivars with longer reproductive growth
	period offset the negative impacts of climate change and increased
	yield. Changes in temperature, precipitation and solar radiation
	in the past three decades jointly increased wheat yield in northern
	China by 0.9â€“12.9%, however reduced wheat yield in southern China
	by 1.2â€“10.2%, with a large spatial difference. Our studies better
	represented crop system dynamics using detailed phenological records,
	consequently better accounted for adaptations such as shifts in sowing
	date and crop cultivars photo-thermal traits when quantifying climate
	impacts on wheat yield. Our findings suggest the response of wheat
	growth and yield to climate change is underway in China. The changes
	in crop system dynamics and cultivars traits have to be sufficiently
	taken into account to improve the prediction of climate impacts and
	to plan adaptations for future. },

	for the stations Kota Bharu, Senai, Cameron highlands and KLIA, respectively).
	We selected four areas in the Peninsular Malaysia and they are south
	coastal, east coastal, west coastal and highland regions. Diurnal
	variation of frequency of rain occurrence is different for different
	locations. We noticed bimodal variation in the coastal areas in most
	of the seasons and unimodal variation in the highland/inland area.
	During the southwest monsoon period in the west coastal stations,
	there is no distinct diurnal variation. The distribution of different
	intensity classes during different seasons are explained in detail

	spatiotemporally matched and are intercompared at multiple time scales

	large disagreements exist between the GR and TG at shorter time scales
	because of their significantly different spatial and temporal sampling
	modes. The yearly biases relative to the GR for the PR and TMI are
	generally negative, with a few exceptions. The COM bias fluctuates
	from year to year over the 12-yr period. The PR, TMI, and COM are
	in good overall agreement with the GR in the lower range of rain

  abstract = {Rainwater harvesting agriculture (RHA) can be a valuable practice
	in increasing crop productivity in the semi-arid region of Loess
	Plateau in China. Due to lack of the detailed data of precipitation
	resources in the region, there have been some difficulties in the
	development of rainwater harvesting agriculture. In this research,
	based on the precipitation data in the last 40 years and topographical
	maps at 25 observation stations in and around Dingxi County, Gansu
	Province, China, the raster digital elevation models (DEM) and the
	average annual precipitation (AAP) databases in the study areas were
	established using ARC/INFO geographical information system (GIS)
	technology. By means of interpolation approaches, statistical model
	and comprehensive approach including nine methods (inverse distance
	weighted (IDW), trend (TRE), spline (SPL), ordinary Kriging (OKR),
	universal Kriging 1 (UK1), universal Kriging 2 (UK2), Thissen polygon
	(THP), multivariate regression (MVR) and comprehensive approach (COM)),
	the spatial and temporal changes of \{AAP\} were calculated and comparatively
	analyzed. Results indicate that simulating precision of the comprehensive
	method is the best in the nine approaches, and its maximum relative
	error is 6.40% and the range of error is 11.66%. The next is ordinary
	Kriging method with exponential model to simulate semivariogram,
	and its maximum relative error reaches 6.76%. As far as the seven
	kinds of interpolation approaches are concerned, the precision of
	ordinary Kriging method is the best, and the error of statistical
	model is relatively high, of which the maximum relative error reaches
	9.04%. The \{AAP\} in Dingxi County calculated by comprehensive approach
	is 420&#xa0;mm, and the water deficit of spring wheat is about 226&#xa0;mm,
	so rainwater harvesting agriculture is feasible in the study area
	if reasonable harvesting technologies are taken. The \{AAP\} information
	system, established by raster precipitation spatial databases using
	optimized methods, can quickly and timely calculate the total quantities
	and the spatial changes of precipitation resources on any scales
	in the study areas, which has an important role in runoff simulating,
	engineering planning, strategy developing, and decision making as
	well as water management in rainwater harvesting agriculture. },

	The aim of this work was to examine the relationship between LAI
	and SVIs in a subtropical rural watershed (in Piracicaba, State of
	SaËœo Paulo, Brazil), for different land covers, and to use the best
	relationship to generate a LAI map for the watershed. LAI was measured
	with a LAI-2000 instrument in 32 plots on the field in areas of sugar
	cane, pasture, corn, eucalypt, and riparian forest. The SVIs studied
	were Simple Ratio (SR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
	and Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), calculated from Landsat-7
	ETM+ data. The results showed LAI values ranging from 0.47 to 4.48.
	LAIâ€“SVI relationships were similar for all vegetation types, and
	the potential model gave the best fit. It was observed that LAIâ€“NDVI
	correlation (r 2=0.72) was not statistically different from LAIâ€“SR
	correlation (r 2=0.70). The worst correlation was obtained by LAIâ€“SAVI
	(r 2=0.56). A map was generated for the study area using the LAIâ€“NDVI
	relationship. This was the first LAI map for the region. },

  abstract = {Information related to land cover is immensely important to global change science. In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 \{MODIS\} Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature, and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75% correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm.},

  abstract = {Arabica coffee production provides a livelihood to millions of people worldwide. Climate change impact studies consistently project a drastic decrease of Arabica yields in current production regions by 2050. However, none of these studies incorporated the beneficial effects that elevated CO2 concentrations are found to have on Arabica coffee yields, the so-called CO2 fertilization effect. To assess the impacts of climate change and elevated CO2 concentrations on the cultivation of Arabica coffee in Brazil, a coffee yield simulation model was extended with a CO2 fertilization and irrigation factor. The model was calibrated and validated with yield data from 1989 to 2013 of 42 municipalities in Brazil and found to perform satisfactorily in both the calibration (R                        2 = 0.91, d = 0.96, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 8.58{\%}) and validation phases (R                        2 = 0.96, d = 0.95, MAPE = 11.16{\%}). The model was run for the 42 municipalities from 1980 to 2010 with interpolated climate data and from 2040 to 2070 with climate data projected by five global circulation models according to the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 scenario. The model projects that yield losses due to high air temperatures and water deficit will increase, while losses due to frost will decrease. Nevertheless, extra losses are offset by the CO2 fertilization effect, resulting in a small net increase of the average Brazilian Arabica coffee yield of 0.8{\%} to 1.48 t ha?1 in 2040--2070, assuming growing locations and irrigation remain unchanged. Simulations further indicate that future yields can reach up to 1.81 t ha?1 provided that irrigation use is expanded.},
